00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.130
We spend an average of 1.5 hours day driving.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.580
That translates to 4.3 years over our entire
lives.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.280
What if we could spend this time focusing
on the things that really matter.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.660
Your help can make this ideal a reality.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.750
With self-driving cars, we can do more during
the time we spend going from place to place.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.160
This technology uses computer vision to identify
different objects on the road and make decisions.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.800
Car companies require huge training datasets
for every country they want to expand to.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.030
Thatâ€™s where you come in.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.440
If you already own a dashcam, the driving
footage you upload to the Road.IO platform

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.140
will be used by current and emerging Autonomous
Car companies to make their products safer

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.520
and drive smoother.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.339
Additionally, you will be compensated for
the videos you submit.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.190
Contribution of data on a global scale will
hasten the development of affordable self

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.109
driving cars in your country.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.309
You have the power to shape the future of
self driving cars.
